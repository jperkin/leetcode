# Rust Leetcode Solutions

My solutions to Leetcode puzzles.  I'm a completely self-taught software
engineer and UNIX nerd, I didn't attend University growing up, and my career
has mostly been about hacking things together and modifying or maintaining
existing code.  Thus I am very very good at making things work, but not
necessarily good at CS fundamentals as I've simply never learned or use them
in practical work.

Recently with my interest in learning Rust I wanted to change that, and so
I've started working through various Leetcode puzzles.  These allow me to
write short pieces of code from scratch, which helps to develop my language
knowledge rather than copy/pasting from existing code, while helping to
develop my skills in algorithms and problem solving.

I'm sharing my solutions here so that they're all in one place and you can see
how I work through things, and maybe also can make suggestions on how I can
improve them.

Obviously it makes absolutely no sense for you to take them and use them as
your own solutions.
